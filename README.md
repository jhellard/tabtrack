# **TabTrack**

TabTrack is an app designed to help keep track of songs you're learning through YouTube. I hope to integrate many features I would like to see myself such as marking difficult sections of a song and slowly upping the speed until I feel fluent, progress/percentage tracking, completion marking and even uploading your own covers to compare to the lessons.

The project is fairly fresh in my mind and I am sure many features will be added in the coming weeks that are not listed above.

The app in its current state is non-functional, keep track for progress updates and look out for a demo soon.
